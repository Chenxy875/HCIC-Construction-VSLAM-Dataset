# Configuring a new LiDAR type to LIMO-Velo
To add your own custom LiDAR point type, take a look at the files ``customLiDAR.cpp`` and ``customLiDAR.hpp`` to see what methods have to be modified and added to which files.

These two codes are **not compiled**, so be sure to add the methods you modify to the adequate files.
